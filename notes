# commands that can be run against the jruby.jar file
java -jar jruby-gems.jar --version
java -jar jruby-gems.jar -e 'puts "goodbye space"'
java -jar jruby-gems.jar -S irb
java -jar jruby-gems.jar -S gem list -l


# Left to do:
- Figure out how to install gems from a local gem server to avoid wireless demo issues.



# issues I've run into

sometimes the jruby-complete.jar file that I download on OS X does not work with -S gem list -l
it gives me a LoadError - rubygems.

# do some cucumber stuff

write a cucumber scenario
